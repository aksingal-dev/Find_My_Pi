# Find_My_Pi
A program that calculates Pi using different methods. Inspired by Matt Parker's Stand Up Maths videos.

Links to individual videos are commented in the begining of their respective classes. The methods currently used are\
  1. The probability of two random numbers are co- prime. Video link: https://youtu.be/RZBhSi_PwHU

  2. The alternating sum of an infinitely many odd numbered series. Video link: https://youtu.be/HrRMnzANHHs  
        Math: ![Alt text](infi_odd.jpg?raw=true "Infinite odd")\
  3. The sum of an infinite square series. Video link: https://youtu.be/S26_O2B8h8k
